# terraform-google-slo

This module deploys the [`slo-generator`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/professional-services/tree/master/tools/slo-generator)
in Cloud Functions in order to compute and export SLOs on a schedule.

## Architecture

![Architecture](./diagram.png)

This module is split into two submodules:

* `slo`: This submodule deploys the infrastructure needed to compute SLO reports
for **one** SLO. Users should use **one invocation of this submodule by SLO defined**.
Once the SLO report is computed, the result is fed to the shared Pub/Sub topic
created by the `slo-pipeline` module.

* `slo-pipeline`: This submodule handles **exporting** SLO reports to different
destinations (Cloud Pub/Sub, BigQuery, Stackdriver Monitoring). The
infrastructure is shared by all SLOs.

## Compatibility

This module is meant for use with Terraform 0.12.

## Usage

First, deploy the SLO pipeline (shared module):

```hcl
module "slo-pipeline" {
  source                      = "terraform-google-modules/slo/google//modules/slo-pipeline"
  function_name               = "slo-export"
  region                      = "us-east"
  project_id                  = "test-project"
  bigquery_project_id         = "test-project"
  bigquery_dataset_name       = "slo_reports"
  stackdriver_host_project_id = "sd-host"
}
```

Now, deploy an SLO definition:

```hcl
module "slo" {
  source     = "terraform-google-modules/slo/google//modules/slo"
  schedule   = var.schedule
  region     = var.region
  project_id = var.project_id
  labels     = var.labels
  config = {
    slo_name        = "pubsub-ack"
    slo_target      = "0.9"
    slo_description = "Acked Pub/Sub messages over total number of Pub/Sub messages"
    service_name    = "svc"
    feature_name    = "pubsub"
    backend = {
      class       = "Stackdriver"
      method      = "good_bad_ratio"
      project_id  = var.stackdriver_host_project_id
      measurement = {
        filter_good = "project=\"${module.slo-pipeline.project_id}\" AND metric.type=\"pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/ack_message_count\""
        filter_bad  = "project=\"${module.slo-pipeline.project_id}\" AND metric.type=\"pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_outstanding_messages\""
      }
    }
    exporters = [
      {
        class      = "Pubsub"
        project_id = module.slo-pipeline.project_id
        topic_name = module.slo-pipeline.pubsub_topic_name
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Additional information, including description of the Inputs / Outputs is
available in [`modules/slo-pipeline/README.md`](./modules/slo-pipeline/README.md) and [`modules/slo/README.md`](./modules/slo/README.md).

Functional examples are included in the
[examples](./examples/) directory.
