# SRE Service Example with Pubsub and Eventarc

This example illustrates how to use the `slo-generator` module, when the run
model is as follow:

- **SRE team** runs the `slo-generator` as-a-service for exporting SLO report **only** (no compute).
- **Team 1** want freedom to compute their SLOs; they want to run their own
`slo-generator` service on Cloud Run, and export only the SLOs they care about.
They use the SRE team export service through Pubsub and Eventarc so that SRE
team can get an overview on all SLOs.
