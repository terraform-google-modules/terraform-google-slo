# SRE Service Advanced Example

This example illustrates how to use the `slo-generator` module, when the run
model is as follow:

- **SRE team** runs the `slo-generator` as-a-service; they put it to disposition for application teams to use on request.
- **Team 1** want freedom to compute their SLOs; they want to run their own `slo-generator` service on Cloud Run, and export only the SLOs they care about to the shared BigQuery dataset owned by SRE.
- **Team 2** does not want to bother running their own service; they want to use the SRE team's service.

## Prerequisites

To run this example, you'll need:

- a GCP project (see an example definition [here](../../test/setup/main.tf).
- the IAM role `roles/owner` on the project for the service account running the Terraform.
- the following APIs enabled on the project:
  - cloudscheduler.googleapis.com
  - cloudrun.googleapis.com
  - secretmanager.goolgeapis.com
  - appengine.gooelapis.com
  - compute.googleapis.com
